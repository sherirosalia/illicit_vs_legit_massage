      <h2>Permeating San Diego: dubious massage locations</h2>      
     
      Research supports a strong assertion: The massage industry in San Diego has been infiltrated by bad actors who are
      parading themselves as "therapeutic" in spite of being unlicensed and offering sexual services. This is based on 
      data extracted through webscraping foreign language, consumer review, salacious advertisment and government websites. 
      The reader is being invited on a journey exploring the seedier side of the industry with access to information 
      unlikely to be found elsewhere. The data also suggests that despite the industry being a vehicle for human trafficking, 
      a significant number of illicit massage ‘providers’ are not coerced and are instead working their way "up" to become proprietors.

      <h5>Massage: 50% illicit</h5>
      <p>
        Almost <strong>half</strong> of the massage establishments reviewed on <a href="https://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a>
        also appear on <a href="https://www.rubmaps.ch/" target="_blank">Rubmaps</a>. Rubmaps is a review site for illicit massage
        that costs about $20 a month and sexual services offered at various locations are graphically described. Check out an
        article about it from NBC news: <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/lawmakers-endorse-new-restrictions-massage-parlors/1969899/" target="_blank">here.</a> Yelp is both an advertising platform
        and a consumer review site. The Yelp home page touts finding the "best businesses in town" such as accountants,
        movers, restaurants and dry cleaners. It is hardly the place one would expect to find illicit services.
      </p>
      <p>The map below shows all massage locations within the City of San Diego. The county is not included. Red circles
        indicate business locations that are also on Rubmaps. The bubble size correlates with the number of reviews on Yelp; 
        the larger bubble sizes associate with high review counts.

      <h5>Unexpected findings</h5>
      <p>
        As a former business owner in the spa industry and still an enthusiastic massage consumer, I keep my eye on 
        the local industry. The dichotomy between mushrooming massage locations and simultaneous shuttering of massage schools
        eventually inspired me to apply the "super powers" of data science to investigate what is going on. Analysis reveals that 
        it is likely increasingly difficult for consumers to be sure that they are patronizing businesses that are in comliance 
        with the law and free from sexual services. Evidence suggests that massage parlors are setting up as "one stop shops", 
        simultaneously accomodating requests for reflexology, a "girls night out" or a "happy ending". 
        One unexpected reason for this seems to be recently weakened massage regulations which are
        supported by the very organizations claiming to protect consumers and/or massage professionals.

      <h5>The consumer challenge </h5>
        <p>
         Not too long ago a blinking neon "Open" sign and locked steel door was a clear signal to anyone looking for 
         therapeutic services to keep walking. However, of the 256 massage parlors listed on "Rubmaps" in the City of San Diego, 
         111 of these locations 
         also appear on Yelp, thereby giving the appearance of legitimacy. In fact some purportedly advertise on yelp as offering 
         other health oriented services such as nutrition, skin care, acupuncture and T.C.M. (Traditional Chinese Medicine).

      These are the locations that have the most reviews on Rubmaps. The bubble size correlates with number of reviews.
      Considering that the site has only been around for about 10 years and that reviewers need to pay in order to post comments 
      as opposed to yelp which is free, some places stand out as potential "hot beds" of activity such as one 
      of the larger bubbles toward the top of the page. Google maps shows the address as an unmarked location in an industrial

      <h5>Beyond Rubmaps: Yelp, government and advertising sites</h5>
      <p>
      Expanding the data sources seems to provide more evidence that many locations, 
      even those purporting to be "therapeutic" in nature are not law compliant. Comparison of phone numbers in
      "Help Wanted" ads from the website: <a href="meimin.us" target="_blank">meimin.us</a>, a chinese
      language version of Craigslist was made to individual practitioner data from Yelp, massage certificate identification from California Massage Therapy Council (CAMTC) 
      and business licence data from the City of San Diego. Some of the findings are shown below.

      <h5>Not enough licenses to go around</h5>
      <p>
      What quickly becomes apparent is that there are not enough massage licenses within to support the number of 
      therapists working in the city. Although a specific number is hard to come by, this is strongly suggested by the
      data used in the visualizations below. For example, certificate numbers extracted from CAMTC data provided a list of 
      1700 unique massage certifications in San Diego which includes the entire county. So, some smaller number would be in the city which is 
      the only area we are analizing. Looking at Yelp alone we can identify 833 locations. 
      Not only do many of these locations employ multiple therapists, but also there are significant numbers of massage therapists who are not listed on 
      Yelp since they work out of their homes. It is hard to account for the number of locations vs. the number of licenses.
      This evidence alone suggests that there are many hanging out the shingle of "massage therapy" or "foot reflexology" that
      fail to comply with the law.

      Data for massage related business licenses from the City of San Diego matched only 22% of the 
      CAMTC certified massage therapists. Since anyone practicing massage or reflexology within the city is supposed 
      to have a business license and certification, this low percentage suggests that many establishments are operating
      without a license, which is against the law.

      <h5>Filtering the 833 massage businesses on Yelp</h5>
      <p>
        One of the challenges in analyzing the data was to figure out which places are "true" massage establishments.
        As seen in the bar chart, many industries advertise massage services on Yelp, however it is not their main source of 
        revenue and their reviews reflect that. 
        Therefore, for the purpose of analyzing how many massage establishments are probably illicit, businesses that are primarily in 
        another industry such as chiropractic, hair and eyelashes were for the most part, not compared.

      The American Massage Therapy Association provides a report on the profile of massage therapists every two years
      and the profile is consistent. Most are certified, female, over the age of 40 and massage is either a side 
      income source or a second career. They are educated anatomy, physiology, multiple modalities and are passionate
      about self care and assisting others to be the best they can be. They also continue training and education for the 
      life of their careers which seems to be roughly six years, and it is not unusual for those that make it past that mark 
      to continue for decades. Read the most recent AMTA report here: <a href = "https://www.amtamassage.org/infocenter/economic_industry-fact-sheet.html" target="_blank">Massage Industry Report</a>

      <h5>Why hasn't this been stopped?</h5>
      <p>
      Research suggests that the answer is complicated and many  
      articles discuss it. Here are two observations that did not seem to get much attention. 
      </p>
      <p>
      There seems to be a loophole provided for the illicit industry by 
      a <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/lawmakers-endorse-new-restrictions-massage-parlors/1969899/" target="_blank">conflict between police regulation and 
      the CAMTC</a>. On one hand, the CAMTC has advocated for less regulation in the massage industry over the past decade including, ironically, the 
      elimination of compliance with local police regulations and O.S.H.A. standards for establishments. This made it 
      no harder to open a shoe store, than a massage place. They also advocated for removal requiring passage of a national exam which 
      evaluated a solid knowledge of anatomy, physiology and proficiency in either english or spanish. Eliminating the test 
      lowered the education barrier. In the first image below it sure seems like the San Diego
      police department feels like their hands are tied, and the second shows the CAMTC announcement eliminating the 
      national exam requirement. California is now one of the few states that does not require therapists to have it.
      </p>
      <p>
      The second observation is that some of the advertising for sexual service providers is being done in foreign language 
      recruitment sites. It is hard to imagine that law enforcement resources would be able to monitor websites such as Meimin which
      equates to a Chinese version of Craigslist. Here's an article about how this works <a href="https://supchina.com/2020/01/30/chinese-moms-in-americas-illicit-massage-parlors/" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <h5>Continuing the journey</h5>
        <p>
        There is much more that could be investigated in relation to this project. For one thing, it could be scaled nationwide as illustrated by 
        the map below which plots all businesses that appear on Rubmaps. Additionally, data shows that some locations that do get shut down are 
        almost simultaneously reopened. Access 
        to court cases and ownership logs may prove to be fascinating. Additonally, since organized crime is thought to be at the helm of illicit massage,
        the true cost to the economy would be interesting to analyze such as tax losses and the effects unfair buisness competition
        has on certified professional massage therapists and consumers.
